# About the project
This project is an attempt to make an external GUI that can be used to configure
**JetBrains ReSharper** options which are commonly stored in .DotSettings files.

Exported settings should work in [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)-enabled tools (VS extension, [free cross-platform CLI tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and Rider).

Currently only C#-related formatting and naming settings are supported.

# Running locally
Clone the repository, make sure you have installed Node and do the usual install:
```
npm install
```
Then launch the development server with:
```
npm run serve
```
